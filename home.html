              We are waste management company based on London. Our main ambition is to make earth free from plastic waste, by recycling waste from housr or office. We provide waste exchange facilite , where user or individual can exchange their waste material with voucher that can be used in any our partner store.
              We provide service like collecting the waste and performing activities such as recycling, composting, incineration, and landfill disposal.
              We believe in making earth greener by reducing plastic waste thrown in sea or land as plastic waste does not decompose easily.
